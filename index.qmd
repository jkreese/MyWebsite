Welcome to my website! Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. student in Government and Politics at the University of Maryland with a focus on American politics, racial and ethnic politics (REP), and the intersections of conservatism and black conservatism. My research explores the ideological barriers within Congress, voter behavior, and emerging movements like black conservatism. From pre-registering studies on Black voter sentiment to building innovative conservatism scales, my work seeks to leave a lasting impact on both academia and the Black community.
